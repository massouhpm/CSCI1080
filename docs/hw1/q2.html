			<h2> Acoustic Guitars </h2>

				<p> These instruments produce sound solely through the vibration of the strings. 
				<br/> What allows them to do this so well is their hollow body design.

			<h2> Electric Guitars </h2>

				<p> These instruments contain built in pickups that convert the string vibrations into an electric signals that are then played through a guitar amplifier. 
				<br/>Although they still are able to produce sound in the same manner as an acoustic, they are generally built with solid bodies so that there is less resonation.

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar">
"The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand."
